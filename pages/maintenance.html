                <h4>Repair, Install, Grout, Patch & More</h4>
                <article>
                    The little things add up. That's why regular maintenance in 
                    and around the home is especially important. With an average 
                    of 10 years' experience, all of our home improvement professionals 
                    know exactly what to look for and how to fix it. From replacing 
                    grout in the bathroom to installing a fan in the attic, let us 
                    tackle the small and large projects on your list.

                <h4>Power Washing Services</h4>
                <article>
                    Santos performs power washing—also known as pressure washing—that
                     removes built-up dirt and debris from decks and patios. You won’t have 
                     to pick up, clean or return a rental power washer. Best of all, the job 
                     will be handled by a professional who knows how to care for your deck and 
                     patio while making it shine

                <h4>Dryer Vent Cleaning</h4>
                <article>
                    Did you know 15,000+ dryer fires occur every year in the United States? 
                    That is just one of the many reasons that regularly scheduled dryer vent 
                    cleaning is beneficial to your home. It’s not enough to clean the lint trap 
                    in your dryer—you need to have a professional come to your house and replace 
                    the ducts between the dryer and the main vent often located behind it.
