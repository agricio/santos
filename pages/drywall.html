                <article>
                    The right shelves can really bring a room together. Shelving is where
                     storage meets style. Our experienced team of handymen can build and/or

                <h4>Crown Molding & Trim Painting</h4>
                <article>
                    Painting crown molding and trim can be a tedious task. We recommend painting 
                    the trim or molding before you install. This saves you time, money and an unsatisfactory 
                    paint job. Let our home improvement professionals know if you're interested in staining or
                    painting your new or existing crown molding.

                <h4>Picture Hanging</h4>
                <article>
                    Depending on size and weight, hanging a frame can be tricky. For heavier mirrors and picture 
                    frames, you may need to locate a stud or use a drywall anchor. The  local Santos Handyman will 
                    make sure that all of your photos, posters, mirrors and artwork are level and secure. We'll 
                    even repair the nail holes left from previous mounts
