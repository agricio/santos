                <article>
                    Expert gutter cleaning by Santos removes the leaves, twigs and sediment that can redirect rain water 
                    to your home's foundation, soffits and fascia. We also repair gutters that have been damaged by the wind, 
                    ice and falling tree limbs. Another solution would be to install gutter guards. Lots of homeowners invest in 
                    gutter guards to eliminate the need for seasonal gutter cleaning. Santos technicians are experienced 
                    installers of the gutter guard product of your choice. One call will help you complete that growing to-do list.
